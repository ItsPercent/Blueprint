## Overview

I, like many other people, kept getting recommended modpacks claiming to provide "The Ultimate Create Experience" like it was the next big thing when in reality, it was just a collection of every mod on the respective mod hosting site with "Create" in the name.

This modpack aims to fix this. Mods and addons are chosen carefully, and are usually heavily modified in order to better suit the modpacks goal. A complete list of all the major changes is below, but to keep it brief, if you dislike vertical item vaults, you're going to like this modpack.

## Showcase
Here is a wonderful video by Mysda that shows off all of the features added in the newest Create Mod update! ([Subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/@Mysda_) to them if you haven't already)

## Pack Changes
Although some powerful mods are in this pack, such as Create: Connected, they have been changed. Here are some of the most important changes that may catch you off guard-

<details>
<summary>Most of the Changes</summary>

- Firework rockets don't work with elytras.\
  This is mainly to encourage building trains, and not just use an elytra to get where your going.
- Computercraft recipes have been changed.\
  Helps to better integrate them with the create mod while also making them harder to obtain.
- Computercraft turtles have been nuked.\
  They're adorable, but too powerful. xD
- Items from Create: Dragons Plus have been removed\
  Liquid dyes are too powerful!
- Basically everything from Create: Connected\
  "Why keep it then?" Well it has some useful features, and jukeboxes on elevators are kinda funny. :P
- And finally...\
  No Copycat Slopes\
  They look goofy, ok?

</details>

## Server Installation
Blueprint can be installed on your minecraft server! Install the `mrpack-install` package on your server and add it to your `/usr/local/bin` directory. From there, navigate to where you want your server to be stored and run `mrpack-install bpcreate` to have the server version directly installed to your drive.

## Issue Reporting
Should you encounter any issues while playing, please let me know using the issues tab. I will get back to you as soon as I can!
